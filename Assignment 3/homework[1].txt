1) Copy the following arrays into your code:

let users = ["Bob", "Dylan", "Marley", "Winston", "Abraham", "Charollete"];
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ];

2) Write a function that accepts an array and a string as arguments. The function should add the string to the end of the array.

3) Write another function that accepts an array an argument. The function should remove the string from the end of the array. Return the element that was removed.

4) Write a third function that accepts an array as an argument. Loop through all of the elements of the array, once the loop gets to the sixth element in the array (i.e. [5]), return that element. If the array does not have a sixth element, return a string that says: "No sixth element"

5) Pass the users array and any string to the first function, then console log users

6) Pass the numbers array to the second function, set the result to a new variable called "poppedValue"

7) console log numbers and poppedValue

8) Pass the users array to the third function, set the result of the function call to a variable, console log the varaible.

9) Pass the numbers array to the third function, set the result of the function call to a variable, console log the variable.
