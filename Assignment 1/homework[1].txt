- Define a function that takes 4 parameters as an argument (the parameters should be num1, num2, and str). Use the function key word to wrtie this function. 

- The function should return a string that in the following format "(value of str) : (num 1 + num2)" i.e. if the function is passed (1, 2, "The sum of num1 and num2"), it should retrun "The sum of num1 and num2 : 3"

-call the function, and console log the result.

-re-write the funciton as an arrow funcition
